## Retrospective

* There were more people, 6 of us?
* We did not go very far and as always wasted time setting up the environment which never work out of the box :(
* Goal was to implement a fixed size LIFO buffer using TDD
  * The problem is interesting esp. on the testing side -> what tests to write
  * we stopped before generalising to more than 1 place buffer
  * we did not try to write one or more interesting Property
  * we did tiny steps not assuming any prior knowledge => maybe a Property would have helped and lead us to do bigger steps
* Teh problem is instersting also because it's in IO which is not where Haskell usually shines -> make good IO/statefule code in Haskell  is still tricky
