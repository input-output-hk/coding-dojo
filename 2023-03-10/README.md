## Retrospective

* We tried Test-Commit-Revert (TCR)
* Write the "red" test before writing the actual code -> pressure having the thing right from the get go almost made us forget about the red part of the test
* Probably something you don't want to do when refactoring your code?
  * Too impactful and annoying...
  * Better suited for greenfield dev
