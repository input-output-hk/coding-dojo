## What is a _Coding Dojo_?

In the [words of the original creators](https://codingdojo.org/practices/WhatIsCodingDojo/) of the concept, Emmanuel Gaillot and Laurent Bossavit:

> A Coding Dojo is a meeting where a bunch of coders get together to work on a programming challenge. They are there to have fun and to engage in [Deliberate Practice](https://codingdojo.org/practices/DeliberatePractice/) in order to improve their skills.

In other words, it's a kind of workshop where we code together "something" but where the emphasis is not on the _results_ but on the _practices_, _tools_ and _techniques_ used. Traditionally, Coding Dojos are great to practice Test-Driven Development, Pair Programming, and Collective Code Ownership which are cornerstones of [eXtreme Programming](http://extremeprogramming.org), but of course there's room for exploring and learning other techniques.

## How does it work?

It's very simple, here is an outline of the process:

* ~2 minutes: Next session
* ~10 minutes: Retrospective
* ~10 minutes: Decide on a topic for this session
* 40 minutes or so: Code together
* 5-10 minutes: Mid-session break to discuss how things are going
* 40 minutes or so: Code some more
* 5 minutes: Closing

The meat of the Dojo is the _coding_ part, of course, which usually follows one of the following patterns:

* A [Prepared Kata](https://codingdojo.org/practices/PreparedKata/) whereby someone has prepared something they want to present
* A [Randori Kata](https://codingdojo.org/practices/RandoriKata/) where coding happens in group, people taking turn at the keyboaard in a round-robin fashion
