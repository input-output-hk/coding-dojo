[2023-02-03](../2023-02-03)

## Retrospective

* Installing dev environment was a pain, we tried a few different things w/ and w/o
  * We even found an issue with HLS on nix, more specifically on darwing aarch64!
  * We got something working w/ ghcup and friends
* I liked coding the diplomacy, it's an interesting game to code, perhaps too large a coding dojo
* Takes some start, felt pretty rusty on the Haskell side, not used to do TDD in Haskell -> was cool to do it that way
  * more used to write scripts in Haskell
